TSF-Bank is an internship project I've made as a Web Development &amp; Designing intern at The Sparks Foundation.

   This is a demonnstration of simple banking transaction system where I've added 10 customers with a random username, email and bank-balance details.

  I've also added transaction history feature in this project.
